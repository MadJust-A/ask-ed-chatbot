## Development

- Built with Next.js 14 and TypeScript
- Uses OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo for responses
- Embedded widget with vanilla JavaScript
- Rate limiting with in-memory storage (use Redis in production)

## Production Considerations

1. Replace in-memory rate limiting with Redis/database
2. Add monitoring and logging

4. Set up error tracking (Sentry, etc.)
5. Add analytics for usage monitoring
